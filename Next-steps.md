# Next steps for getting your PWA into the Google Play Store
You've successfully generated a Google Play Store app package (`.apk`) for your PWA. This app package can be submitted to Google Play Store. ðŸ˜Ž

## Deploy Digital Asset Links file - IMPORTANT!

You need to deploy a Digital Asset Links file to your server to prove you own your domain URL. The [TWA Quick Start Guide](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/08/twas-quickstart#creating-your-asset-link-file) explains how to do this.

**Digital asset links are required for your PWA to load without the browser address bar**. If you're seeing a browser address bar in your app on Android, you likely forgot to generate your digital asset links file.

## Submitting your APK

The zip file generated by this tool contains a `.apk` file. This file can be submitted directly to the Play Store through the [Google Play Console](https://developer.android.com/distribute/console).

## Save your signing key

If your zip file contains a `.keystore` signing key file, keep it in a safe place. 

If you need to resumbit your app in the future, you'll need to sign it with this same key. You can read more [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing#opt-out) about securing your key and opting into App Signing by Google Play. We strongly recommend using App Signing By Google Play as this lessens the risk of losing your signing key.
